  <h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
  
    <p>
       My personal knowledge of artificial intelligence was limited by the fact that this is some kind of "smart" system that controls
      bots in games.

       According to the Wiki's description, an artificial intelligence sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to
      the natural intelligence displayed by humans and other animals. In computer science AI research is defined as the study of
      "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully
      achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is applied when a machine mimics "cognitive" functions
      that humans associate with other human minds, such as "learning" and "problem solving".
